# personal project experimenting with shiny for python

## minimal documentation

with a python environment that has shiny installed, run the following at the CLI:

`shiny create my_app` (first time only)
`shiny run --reload my_app/app.py`

main.py is set up to run the second listed command-- as-is, it isn't re-entrant.
(For now, stop and restart PyCharm. Later, refresh on shiny and/or learn the python versions of those commands in the pyshiny framework.)
